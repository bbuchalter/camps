<h1>Welcome to DevCamps.org!</h1>

<p>DevCamps are a system for easily managing development, integration, staging, and production environments. Each environment is called a camp.</p>

<p>Focused on web applications, camps make developers more efficient, and make the agile development and deployment lifecycle easy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Business users and developers easily collaborate on projects in real time</li>
<li>Quickly get new developers up to speed without hours of setup on their own computers</li>
<li>Works with existing version control and continuous integration systems</li>
<li>Easily juggle multiple simultaneous projects</li>
<li>Provide superior coordination for teams of developers</li>
<li>Keep development databases in sync with production</li>
</ul>

<p>DevCamps were developed at <a href="http://www.endpoint.com/">End Point</a> and are in extensive use on several dozen sites.</p>
