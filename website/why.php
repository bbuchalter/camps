<h1>Why use camps?</h1>

<div class="mixcase">

<ul>
<li>Quickly get new developers up to speed without hours of setup on their own computers</li>
<li>Break out of the isolation of the individual developer's computer</li>
<li>Keep production, staging, and development as similar as possible</li>
<li>Have separate web server, app server, and database per project, to isolate changes</li>
<li>Use https in development too -- avoid browser security warning surprises</li>
<li>Intercept outgoing email to facilitate testing</li>
<li>Works with existing version control and continuous integration systems</li>
<li>Use realistic development databases and sync with production</li>
<li>Provide superior coordination for teams of developers</li>
<li>Easily juggle multiple simultaneous projects</li>
</ul>
