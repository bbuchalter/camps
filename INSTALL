INSTALLATION NOTES
------------------

General information about installing/setting up camps is available on

Recent Changes
--------------
If you use PostgreSQL as your backend database, you will need to
explicitly choose a postgresql.conf target to match your
installed/used PostgreSQL version. Previously, the default had been
for 8.1's configuration file, and was recently changed to 8.3.

If you are running camps from the git repo, your symlink will have
disappeared with recent changes; never fear, just explicitly symlink
the appropriate file.

Something similar to the following should get you started:

  # su - camp
  $ cd pgsql
  $ ln -sf postgresql-8.4.conf postgresql.conf

Obviously you would select the correct version of the postgresql.conf
file appropriate to your PostgreSQL configuration. If in doubt,
run: `postgres --version`.
